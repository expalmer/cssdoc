CSS3 animation allows animation of all html element without the need of Javascript or Flash. 
However, there are two propeties KeyFrame and animation that get an animation style to work in css.
The keyFrame hold what style an element will have at a certain time, and animation property
define how it should be animated.


```example
  <!-- To animate a section in the webpage. -->
  
  ```html 
  <div class="anim">
  <H1>Bounce In</H1> 
  </div>
  
  ```code for css
  <!-- To include animation to anim class -->
  @keyframes bounceIn{			//The style of the animation is define here. Other slide include, slide, springy-text, sliding-vertically, etc.
	 0%{
		  transform: scale(0.1);		//The style at the start of the animation
		  opacity:0;
	    }
	 50%{
		   transform: scale(1.2);		//The style when the animation is 50% complete
		  opacity:1;
	     }
	 100%{
		   transform: scale(1);			//The style when the animation is 100% complete
	     }
		 
  <!-- To apply animation to anim class -->
	.anim {
		animation-name:bounceIn;		//as declared in keyFrame
		animation-duration:2s;			//the duration of animation which can also be in milliseconds(e.g., 100ms)
	}
 
  <!-- This will be the shorthand code to write -->
  .anim {
	  animation:bounceIn 2s;   
  }

  <!-- other properties of aninmation to add -->
 .anim {
		animation-name:bounceIn;		
		animation-duration:2s;	
		animation-timing-function:ease;			//Defines the pace of the animation, e.g ease-out, ease-in-out, linear, intial, etc.
		animation-delay:2s;						//When you want the animation to start once its triggerd
		animation-iteration-count:3;			//How many times you want the animation to play
		animation direction:alternate-reverse;	//This specify how the animation should be played, in-reverse, forward or in alternate cycles.
		animation-fill-mode:backwards;			//This cause your style of animation to be visible before or after plays
	}
	
   <!-- To shorthand this code, every property can be separated by comas -->
 .anim {
	 animation: bounceIn, 2s, ease, 2s, 3, alternate-reverse, backwards
 }
	 
```
