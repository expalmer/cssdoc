The use of css multi-column layout allows users to read multiple
 lines of text without losing track of which line they were on, 
 on the webpage. So the column of text placed side-by-side as seen in newspapers. 
 there are different properties of css column

```example
  <!-- Column-count property sets the column of the page according to the number given. -->
  
  ```html 
  <div id="col">The life of man is not determined by the background or its eductional 
  qualification but my its ability to change it thinking. Your thinking determines who you are</div>
  
  ```code for css
  #col {
	  column-count :2;  // This display the content into two column
  }
 
  <!-- Column-width property sets the width of the column  -->
  #col {
	  column-width :100px;  
  }

  <!-- Column-gap property sets the gap between the column  -->
  #col {
	  column-gap :30px;  
  }
  
   <!-- Column-rule property sets a line between each column, and can also be style with given a color and width   -->
  #col {
	  column-rule :2px, outset, #00ff00;  
  }
   <!-- Column-fill property sets how content partitioned into column, it can be Balance, Auto, Inherit or Intial -->
  #col {
	  column-fill :balance;   //Content in all the columns will have the same height.
	  column-fill:auto;       //This fill the colunm seqentially
	  column-fill:inherit;    //This property inherit from his parent element.
	  column-fill:intial;     //set the property to its default value.
  }
  
  
```
